A PhD candidate majoring in bioinformatics at Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology. 

For biology, my interest is on illustrating the mechanisms of the development of a life body. Currently, my project focuses on understanding the cross-talks among epigenetic regulators in stochasic gene regulation program. My aim is to construct a model to predict the expression level of genes given the status of their regulators.

Besides, I am crazy about computational technology and mining big data. For all the time, I want to start a company to dig into amounts of data to predict the world.
