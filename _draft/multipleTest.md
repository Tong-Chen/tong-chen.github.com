I would need a better understanding of your experimental design - I will try to describe what I did understand from your answers.

* You are working with two groups,  experimental and control
* Each group conducts the same tests (comparison of numbers,  recognition of patterns,  processing speed and speech articulation speed)
	* You want to compare the results of each test between the groups
	
	From my understanding,  there is no correction necessary. Consider the following scenario: a psychologist and an economist are using the same participants for their studies,  e.g. for a survey,  just to save money and time. If they analyse the data independently,  no one would ever ask for a correction of their results.
	
	But this is the important sentence: If you dont mix the results/tests,  then you are fine. If you draw at the end a concluding summary of all four tests,  one could argue that they are not really independent.
	
	Like Jeff already said,  a MANOVA might be a better way to start. If this MANOVA is statistical significant,  according to Field t-tests for post-hoc analysis are ok. 
	
	However my personal opinion is,  that no correction is necessary,  if I described your experimental design in an accurate way.
